# Book-Management-System
Brief implementation of a book management system website using Flask + Vue3

# Description
This is a book management system website developed based on Flask and Vue3 frameworks, it's mainly used for a demonstration of applying Flask in backend development. The whole development phase is essentially the same as the other [Student Request Portal](https://github.com/dennnnnnnnnis/COMP30022-ACT20-TEAM01) that I implemented as a capstone project in the University of Melbourne with my other teammates. The only difference is the language used for backend development (That one with Springboot Framework under Java).

Note that this is only a starting phase of the website, currently APIs are successfully built and connected, with data in the databse returned and rendered on the webpage, the rest of the development will just be the UI design as well as some other fancy functionalities.

The repository will be occasionally updated if I have time to finish the rest of the development (to make it a nicer and better website), but for now, the main purpose is the acknowledgement of able to develop under Flask framework as well.

# Instructions
To run the website, make sure you have npm installed and all related flask libraries installed, then try `npm start`

The website should look like this ![ta-da!](https://github.com/dennnnnnnnnis/Book-Management-System/issues/1#issue-2257966221)
